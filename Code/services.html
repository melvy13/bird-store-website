                <h2>Bird Grooming</h2>
                <p>Though birds do not need as much grooming as cats and dogs, that does not mean you can ignore it completely. 
                    Birds also require some grooming once in a while to keep them healthy, clean and pretty! With over 7 years 
                    of experience, I offer grooming services for all types of birds safely, while keeping them as relaxed and 
                    least stressful as possible. Book your appointment using the form <a href="services.html#form">below</a>!</p>
            </div>
            <div class="serviceinfo">
                <img src="Photos/petbirdpic3.jpg">
                <p>The four main types of grooming services that I provide are: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Beak Trimming</b></li>
                    <p>In truth, pet birds can naturally keep a healthy beak length by chewing foods and playing shredding toys. 
                    However, there's a chance the beaks can still overgrow and need some external help. In that case, 
                    <strong>never</strong> trim a bird's beak yourself unless you are a professional. Beak trimming is a 
                    complicated process, and doing so incorrectly can cause harm to the pet bird. In turn, it may affect your 
                    relationship with it.</p><br>
                    <li><b>Wing Trimming</b></li>
                    <p>Like beak trimming, wing trimming is also a rather complicated process and should be done by none other than 
                    a professional. Doing this process incorrectly could affect the bird's ability to fly safely and become 
                    injured. </p><br>
                    <li><b>Nail Trimming</b></li>
                    <p>Nail trimming helps keep your bird comfortable and also prevent your house (or yourself) from getting 
                    scratches. Bird's nails grow pretty fast and usually need to trimmed once every few months. If you want to 
                    trim it yourself, it is recommended that you get a helper to hold the bird for you, while you trim the 
                    nails.</p><br>
                    <li><b>Bird Bathing</b></li>
                    <p>Bathing your bird will keep it clean and hygenic. It also keeps their skin from being dry and itchy, which 
                    could lead to feather-plucking &mdash; a feather damaging behaviour. Birds only need baths once or twice a 
                    week, and if you plan to bath the bird yourself, be sure to use only clear plain water with a comfortable 
                    temperature. Do watch the video below on how to properly bathe a pet bird!</p><br>

                <h2>Bird Boarding</h2>
                <p>If you are going to be away from home on holidays, don't leave your bird in the cage! They will feel lonely 
                    and bored, while also not getting enough exercise. To keep your feathered companion healthy, I am happy to 
                    offer you bird boarding services and take care of your bird while you enjoy your time! I will provide 
                    necessary food while giving them sufficient play time, interaction and attention. Book your appointment 
                    using the form <a href="services.html#form">below</a>!</p>
            </div>
            <div class="serviceinfo">
                <img src="Photos/petbirdpic4.jpg">
                <p><strong>If your bird was not purchased from this store, your bird will have to be tested for diseases before 
                    it can board with me. This is necessary to protect your bird and other birds around the area.</strong><br>
                    I will update you with photo of your feathered friend periodically while you are away, so you can continue 
                    to feel relaxed and enjoy your holiday without worrying too much!
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>You are advised to book an appointment at least 2 weeks in advance to avoid full bookings, especially during 
                    school holiday periods such as the summer break and end&ndash;of&ndash;year break, or public holidays such 
                    as Chinese New Year and Christmas. This is because I can only board about 10 birds at a time to allow 
                    every one of them to get enough attention everyday.
